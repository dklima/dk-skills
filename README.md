## What is in here

### `okf-bundle`

Builds an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format)
v0.2 bundle for a codebase (markdown with YAML frontmatter, versioned next to
the code) and wires a gate that fails the build when the two drift apart.

The format is the easy half. The gate is the point:

- a block that copies names out of the code is pinned to the file it came from,
  so a rename in the source breaks the document that describes it;
- every relative link has to resolve;
- an author cannot sign off their own document, so "human-reviewed" always means
  two people;
- a re-read date that passes fails the build until somebody else reads it.

Every rule also states what it does **not** prove. A green build that implies
"reviewed and correct" is worse than no build, because it stops people looking.

The validator is language-agnostic and ships with a `--self-test` that breaks a
bundle 18 ways and confirms each break is caught, plus 6 pieces of legitimate
but awkward markdown that must stay green. That second half matters as much as
the first: a gate that fails on correct input gets deleted.

Requires Python 3 and PyYAML.
